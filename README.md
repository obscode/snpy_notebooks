# SNooPy Notebooks

This repository contains a collection of notebooks for learning SNooPy. Aside from the basic,
my plan is to showcase specific use-cases, particularly when they are requested, so by all means
make suggestions for what you'd want to see.

These use-cases may make it into the core SNooPy code base once they have been vetted.

Of course, you'll need to have [SNooPy installed](https://csp.obs.carnegiescience.edu/data/snpy), 
as well as jupyter notebooks.

## Using

First, you'll want to download this repository into a working folder:

    $ git clone https://github.com/obscode/snpy_notebooks
  
Then, cd to the folder and launch jupyter notebooks:

     $ cd snpy_notebooks
     $ jupyter notebook
